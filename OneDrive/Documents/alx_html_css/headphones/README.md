#  Headphones Landing Page

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Web Development** curriculum.  
It demonstrates responsive web design, semantic HTML, and modern CSS layout techniques for a fictional headphones landing page.


##  Features

- Hover effects on links (`#FF6565`) and buttons (`opacity: 0.9`)  
- Maximum content width: 1000px, centered on the page  
- Built with HTML5 and CSS3 â€” no frameworks or JavaScript used
